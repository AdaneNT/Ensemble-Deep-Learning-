## Datasets Used

This study evaluated the proposed hybrid deep ensemble model on three datasets:

### 1. WISDM v1.1
- Smartphone accelerometer data
- 6 activity classes: Walking, Jogging, Upstairs, Downstairs, Sitting, Standing
- Sampling rate: 20 Hz
- Used **undersampling** for class balancing
- WISDM Dataset Dataset link : https://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php
  
### 2. UCI HAR
- IMU data (accelerometer + gyroscope) from smartphones
- 6 activities: Walking, Upstairs, Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Lying
- Sampling rate: 50 Hz
- Preprocessed and balanced â†’ no resampling needed
- UCI HAR Dataset Dataset link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones

### 3. Smart Belt Dataset
- Collected from 12 participants using a custom belt with 3 IMU sensors (sampling rate: 100 Hz)
- Activities: Walking, walking upstairs/downstairs, sitting, standing, lying
- Annotated using [**NOVA**](https://github.com/hcmlab/nova)
- Dataset available in the [`Datasets/`](./Datasets/) folder (`smart_belt_dataset.csv`)  
  or externally from the [ALAMEDA Project](https://alamedaproject.eu/)
- Oversampling applied to balance activity classes

## Results

| Model             | Accuracy   |
|------------------|------------|
| CNN-BiGRU         | ~99.91%    |
| CNN-LSTM          | ~99.91%    |
| CNN-BiLSTM        | ~99.87%    |
| **Stacked Ensemble** | **99.96%** |

Confusion matrix heatmaps and classification reports are generated in each notebook.
